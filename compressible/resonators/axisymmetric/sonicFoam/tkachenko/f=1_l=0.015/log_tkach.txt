The sonicFoam functionality has been merged into the transonic option of the
latest rhoPimpleFoam solver and the sonicFoam tutorials moved into the
rhoPimpleFoam tutorials directory.

To run rhoPimpleFoam in transonic mode set the transonic option in the
PIMPLE sub-dictionary of fvSolution:

PIMPLE
{
    .
    .
    .
    transonic            yes;
}
